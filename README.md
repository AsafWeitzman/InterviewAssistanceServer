# Interview Manager App Server

This repository contains the backend code for the Interview Manager app, which is designed to help job seekers manage their interview processes more efficiently. The backend is built using Node.js and Express, and it communicates with a MySql database to store and retrieve data.

## Tech

The Interview Manager app includes a login system that allows users to securely access their data. Passwords are stored using the bcrypt library, which hashes and salts the passwords before storing them in the database. Authentication is handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which are used to create an access token that is stored in the user's local storage. This access token is used to authenticate requests made to the API, ensuring that only authorized users are able to access and modify their interview data.
